    在中国个人进行股权融资、发行数字货币等都是违法的，但有很多人才与项目无法获得资金。 像孙正义这样的国际投资人由于不了解当地的情况，进行了很多无效投资，致使严重负债。
我认为自己有能力帮助他们有效投资、融资，增加国际资本流动与科技发展速度。主要会用于当今比较热门的AI领域。
     
     It is illegal for individuals to conduct equity financing and issue digital currency in China, but there are many talents and projects that cannot obtain funds. International investors like Masayoshi Son have made many ineffective investments due to lack of understanding of local conditions, resulting in serious debts.
     I think I have the ability to help them effectively invest, raise funds, increase international capital flow and the speed of technological development.
It will be mainly used in the popular AI field.
